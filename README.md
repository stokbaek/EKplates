# EKplates #

**This is a fork of EKE00372 addon (https://github.com/EKE00372/EKplates)**

## Changes made in this fork follows: ##
* Option to show castbar instead of cast icon when using numberstyle.
* CC debuffs are in their own section and can be turned on/off, This makes it possible to use whitelist for your owndebuffs while still showing CC from other players.
* Shows taunt effect on nameplates and option to show others taunt too.
